# Prompt:Response
We need to see what type of prompts and responses we would need for a drafter and interpreter.
The best fit design would be to have 4 fine-tuned models with 1 model for syntaxing to preposition-article-noun and another for syntaxing back to standard english. 1 model for interpreting the preposition-article-noun contracts, laws and regulations. 1 model for drafting contracts, laws and regulations.

## PAN Syntaxer
We must use a fine-tuned model for the syntaxing of normal-english to PAN (Preposition-article-noun).
This is done by showing a prompt:response format to GPT-3.5-turbo of syntaxing from normal-english to PAN.

## PAN Translator
The need for a seperate fine-tuned model for the translation from PAN to normal-english is needed to get more accurate results. Although a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-turbo would have enough knowledge of the grammar it is believeable that a fine-tuned model for the translation back to normal english would bring better results.
